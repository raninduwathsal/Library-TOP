# Library-TOP
This repository is created for the Library assignment of the Odin Project and 
As a research project of my own, in the research I'm making the frontend(HTML and CSS) mainly Using two AI assistants and another one 100%human,
The ai assistants are chatgpt and purecode.ai, 

**Skip this paragraph if you're not going through the commit history**
```at first I used chat gpt prompts to create the frontend of the main(an older version of main) and used the help of chat gpt to write the js code too, then I pushed that code to a branch called chatgpt and rewrote the main branch with 100%Human code,```

The next ai tool is purecode.ai AI frontend designer tool, I have not currently used that but it will be available in the future under a branch named pureCode.

*This branch (main) is the 100% human coded one,* 

The purpose of this research is to determine if purecode.ai is better than chatgpt on frontend development only, Please pay no attention to the javascript code as the ones in the branches other than main may be unfinished...

#TODO : Write a finished research article about my findings in my Medium page.
